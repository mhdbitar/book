<p class="title">( Thinking, Fast and Slow )</p> 
<p class="prghraf">Allow me to just gush : This book is damn awesome, read it!
Seriously though,  <br> for behavioral research, there are few books that touch the scope and breadth that Dan Kahneman dives into with this masterpiece <br>
Mr. Kahneman holds a Nobel Prize in economics as well, and this aspect shines through in the books many examples.

<p class="title"> (The Art of Choosing) </p> 
<p class="prghraf"> This is the quintessential read on how human beings make choices and what external influences affect those choices. 
<br> Needless to say, I was fascinated by the idea that choice can actually overwhelm, causing people to delay choosing rather than benefit from the extra options offered.<br> It is a fantastic read and very enjoyable all the way through, I happen to consider Sheena a great writer as well as a great researcher. <br><h5> Evaluation : 8/10 </h5> </p>

<p class="title"> (Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die )</p>
<p class="prghraf"> Definitely one of my favorite marketing books ever written , but it is not something that can only be enjoyed by marketers.  <br> This quote from Mark Twain is included in the books description: A lie can get halfway around <br> the world before the truth can even get its boots on.<br> The authors offer an explanation as to why these ideas can stay with us for so long.
<br> this book aims to address the 6 ways certain ideas just stay with us while others slip away. <br> <h5> Evaluation : 8/10 </h5> </p>

<p class="title">  (How to Win Friends & Influence People )  </p>

<p class="prghraf">   
This is the first self-improvement book. Written in 1937,  by Carnegie can truly be called a classic. <br> It shows what we all intuitively know: it does not matter what your line of work is or what you want to achieve- if you are doing business of any kind, you need to make it about the other person. Being nice helps, a lot. this book does not distinguish between genuine interest and faking  <br> it to get what you want, it still contains a treasure chest full of timeless wisdom. <br> this book still draws millions of readers to this day. <br> <h5> Evaluation : 9/10 </h5> </p>

<p class="title"> (Think and Grow Rich: The Original 1937 Unedited Edition ) </p>
<p class="prghraf"> This book is all about material gain, and while it certainly covers that area, it is about much more than that.  <br> Perhaps the first explicit mention of positive thinking, on how to care not just about the cash in your pocket, <br> but also the thoughts in your head, this book has been able to withstand the destruction of time. <br> It covers all the basics from planning, decision making and persistence . <br> <h5> Evaluation : 8/10 </h5> </p>

<p class="title"> (The 48 Laws of Power) </p>
<p class="prghraf">  How people use power for their own benefit and what to do to protect yourself from certain abuses of power.  <br> Besides the fact that all stories in this book gravitate around power,<br> it contains many life lessons, amazing historical anecdotes and, if read in a certain light, the ability to use power for good.<br> <h4> Evaluation : 8/10 <h4> </p>
