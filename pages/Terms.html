Goodreads eBook Giveaway Terms & Conditions

NO PURCHASE OR PAYMENT OF ANY KIND IS NECESSARY TO ENTER OR WIN.

By entering a Goodreads eBook Giveaway (each, a “Sweepstakes”), you will be bound by these Terms & Conditions and you acknowledge that you satisfy all eligibility requirements. “Goodreads” means Goodreads LLC or any of its affiliates.

Eligibility. Open to individual legal residents of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia who have a Goodreads and an Amazon.com account and are the older of 18 years of age or the legal age of majority in their state of residence prior to the date of entry. Employees of Sponsor, Goodreads and its affiliates, and their immediate family members are not eligible to participate.

Sponsor. The Sponsor is the individual or entity offering the Sweepstakes on the Sweepstakes Landing Page. Neither Goodreads nor any of its affiliates is a sponsor of the Sweepstakes.

Prize(s) and Winner Selection Method. The Sponsor will award a prize to one or more individuals who enter at the Sweepstakes point of entry (“Sweepstakes Landing Page”) using the selection method identified below. The Sweepstakes Landing Page will specify the Sponsor, prize, approximate retail value, and when each Sweepstakes begins and ends (which may be sooner than the end dates and times provided depending on the available supply of prizes). Entrants who submit an eligible entry will be selected randomly to be potential winner(s). Odds of winning depend on the number of eligible entries received.

You must have a Goodreads and an Amazon.com account in order to enter or receive a prize. Limit one entry per person and household using only one Goodreads/Amazon.com account per Sweepstakes. Prizes will be fulfilled by the Sponsor and delivered by Amazon.com, Inc. or one of its affiliates. Each winner will be responsible for paying income taxes and any other expenses incurred.

Each prize will be awarded “as is” and without warranty of any kind, express or implied (including, without limitation, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose). If you win a prize, you may not transfer, assign, or redeem the prize for cash. The Sponsor or Goodreads may substitute a prize with a prize of equal or greater value.

How to Enter. On the Sweepstakes Landing Page, confirm you have a U.S. address (you may be required to log in to your Goodreads and/or Amazon.com account) and follow the entry form instructions. If you are a winner, an e-mail notification will be sent to you and you will be able to access your prize using your Amazon.com account.

Other Sweepstakes. By entering a Sweepstakes, you will not be eligible to receive any prizes awarded in any other Sweepstakes unless you enter each Sweepstakes separately.

Additional Terms. Sponsor, together with Goodreads, reserves the right to modify or cancel a Sweepstakes at any time. Sponsor and Goodreads and its affiliates are not responsible for: (a) lost, misdirected, late, or incomplete entries or for inaccurate entry information; (b) any operation or transmission error, theft, unauthorized access to, or alteration of, entries; or (c) damage to any computer or device resulting from downloading Sweepstakes materials. Sponsor, together with Goodreads, may disqualify any individual found to be: (x) tampering with a Sweepstakes; (y) violating these Terms & Conditions; or (z) acting in an unsportsmanlike or disruptive manner or with intent to threaten or harass any person. Incomplete and robotic, automatic, programmed or similar entries will be disqualified. The authorized subscriber of the account used to enter a Sweepstakes at the actual time of entry will be deemed to be the participant and must comply with these Terms & Conditions in the event of a dispute as to entries submitted by multiple users having the same e-mail account.

No greater than the number of prizes stated on the Sweepstakes Landing Page will be awarded. If any errors occur in the selection of a potential winner, or if more prizes are claimed than specified, Sponsor or Goodreads may award the prize(s) by random drawing from among all eligible claimants. All prizes made available for a Sweepstakes may not be awarded in the event Sponsor or Goodreads does not receive a sufficient number of qualified and eligible entries for an applicable Sweepstakes.

Miscellaneous. Each Sweepstakes is governed by the laws of the United States. By entering a Sweepstakes, you agree (for yourself and your heirs) that Sponsor, Goodreads, and each of their respective affiliates and agents, and any entity involved in any aspect of the Sweepstakes (all aforementioned parties are collectively, the “Released Parties”) will have no liability, and will be held harmless from and against liability, loss, injury or damage to property or person, including death, and reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs, due in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, by reason of the acceptance, possession, use or misuse of a prize or participation in the Sweepstakes, even if caused or contributed to by the negligence of any of the Released Parties.

You agree that Sponsor’s decisions related to each Sweepstakes and all distribution of prizes are final. Each winner agrees that, by participating in a Sweepstakes, Sponsor, Goodreads, and their respective affiliates may use the winner’s name in any manner and in any medium for its promotional purposes without additional compensation, including posting in a winner’s list, except where prohibited by law, and Sponsor, Goodreads, and their respective affiliates may be required to disclose the winner’s address to state regulatory authorities.

Privacy Notice: All information submitted in connection with this Sweepstakes will be treated in accordance with these Terms & Conditions, Goodreads’ Privacy Policy, and Amazon.com’s Privacy Notice.
